This repository contains the source code used to develop the model for author prediction and the web app with Flask and React.js, to serve the predictions.

### Demo

The WebApp can take tweets as the input, and can give out the prediction at the click of a button in the same UI.

* Flask was picked for its easy integration with Python to leverage the packages for preprocessing while serving the model
* React provides cross-platform compatibility, hence maximum reusability and simplicity
